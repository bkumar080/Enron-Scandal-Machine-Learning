# Enron-Scandal-Machine-Learning

Enron Corporation is an American energy, commodities, and utilities based company, which is well known example of willful corporate fraud and corruption. It was the biggest accounting frauds in the history. Many professionals were questioned and accused for various fraud activities and some of them were sent to jail. This fraud led to the collapse of the company including bankruptcy in 2002. During its investigation the Federal Energy Regulation Commission released a large dataset of top executives and their emails and confidential financial data. As a Data Analyst with the help of Machine Learning lets figure out a best model which suites these data to detect whether a person is involved in this scandal or not.
